# Machine Learning Project

This repo contains our project of Cin UFPE's subject of Machine Learning. 

We reviewed in our first project the article "Predicting the Turkish Stock Market BIST 30 Index using Deep Learning", and, we will do some modifications:

- The target value will be the brazilian market index, IBOV;
- Classification target will be -1 if we have negative variation and 1 if positive
- We will test 4 classification models: MLP, Random Forest, Grandient Boosting and SVM;
- We will add cross validation. 
- We will add backtesting (since now the problem is of classification, we can calculate the return and compare to buy and hold strategy)
