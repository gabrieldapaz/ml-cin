# Machine Learning Project

This repo contains our project of Cin UFPE's subject of Machine Learning. 

We reviewed in our first project the article "Predicting the Turkish Stock Market BIST 30 Index using Deep Learning", and, we will do some modifications:

- The target value will be the brazilian market index, IBOV;
- We will add a feature of market sentiment;
- We will test 4 classification models: MLP, Random Forest, Grandient Boosting and SVM;
- We will add cross validation.
